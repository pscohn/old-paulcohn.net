A little behind the times, I finished season 5 of Game of Thrones today.

The one question that keeps coming back to me is: does my unhappiness make this show good or bad? Is it wrong to want my heroes to triumph and villains to die, and does doing the opposite make Game of Thrones better?

Nearly every episode ends with a mixture of fury and hope, and only once or twice did I actually get excited by a character's success, and those hopeful moments were later abandoned by more fear and failure. We begin to see a more human side to Stanice, and he becomes one of the few people left to cheer for, especially as he turns toward Winterfell to take on one of the main villains of the season. Things don't wind up for a great battle, though. His army falls apart and there's another disappointment. The Stark girls are at low points, and Jon has seen better days.

The few victories we do get don't feel good for very long. Cersei finally gets sweet justice, but it goes to far and we're left feeling sorry for her, until finally we're actually rooting for her to crush her enemies.

The arc of this show seems to be like an endless figure-8. The heroes rise up to defeat a great villain, they are killed off, and then the villain becomes subject to an evil even worse, and in turn become the hero to root for and, eventually, fall. It's a revolving door of characters that, while entertaining, doesn't stop me from hoping for enough stability to feel excited for a character. There are only two mainstays left to hope for that even the producers know would be dangerous to kill off, but we'll see what season 6 has in store for them.
